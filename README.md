# Mentor Matching System

Develops a system that connects participants with experienced 
mentors based on their interests and areas of expertise.

The GUI/frontend provides a list of participants for mentors 
to choose from when selecting students. The students' IDs, names,
and skills are provided along with a brief description.

To start the program, one must first download the project and 
start the server file. Currently, there is no way to add 
participants unless done remotely through an API platform 
like Postman.

The project uses mainly Javascript, and the database being used
is MongoDB. This is what stores the participants' information.
